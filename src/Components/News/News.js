                  <div>

                      <div class="text-justify">
                          <p class="">Cranial faults refer to misalignments in the bones of the cranium, which can
                              have a
                              significant impact on overall health and well-being. These faults can cause various
                              symptoms such as headaches,neck pain,jaw pain,tinnitus, and more.Dental correction is
                              one approach that can help address cranial faults and improve overall well-being. </p>

                          <p class="mt-5"> The cranial bones are interconnected and form a delicate system that works
                              together to
                              protect the brain and spinal cord. Cranial faults can occur due to a variety of factors,
                              including birth trauma, physical or emotional trauma, and chronic stress. When the bones
                              of the cranium are not in proper alignment, it can create imbalances in the body and
                              lead to various symptoms.</p>

                              <p>Dental correction is a holistic approach that uses dental appliances to correct

                                  faults and improve overall well-being. The appliances are designed to adjust the
                                  position of the jaw and help the cranial bones return to their proper alignment.
                                  This
                                  can reduce the symptoms associated with cranial faults and improve overall health.
                                  The benefits of dental correction for cranial faults include:</p>

                              <p>The process of dental correction for cranial faults typically involves several steps.
                                  First, a thorough evaluation is performed to determine the cause of the cranial
                                  faults
                                  and determine the best course of action. Next, the dentist will create a custom
                                  dental
                                  appliance specifically designed to correct the cranial faults. This appliance is
                                  then
                                  worn as directed by the dentist to gradually correct the imbalances and bring the
                                  cranial bones back into proper alignment.</p>

                                  In conclusion, dental correction is a holistic approach that can be effective in
                                  addressing cranial faults and improving overall health and well-being. By
